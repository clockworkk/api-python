Handshake Python Wrapper
=======================

This python wrapper can be used to easily make calls to the Handshake api and perform the following Tasks:
	
	Users
		Get Users
		Create Users
		Delete Users
		Update Users
	
	Reports
		Add Content
		Add Content
		Add Content
		Add Content

Usage
=====

Using this wrapper is very simplistic and requires only a few lines of code

	from handshake import Handshake

After importing the wrapper you need to initialize the Handshake class with your API key.

	hs = Handshake("insert_api_key_here")

Performing tasks after this point is as easy knowing what function to call.
